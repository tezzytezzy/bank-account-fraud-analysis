BAF is a realistic, complete, and robust test bed to evaluate novel and existing methods in ML and fair ML, and the first of its kind!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**This suite of datasets is:**\\\\n- Realistic, based on a present-day real-world dataset for fraud detection;\\\\n- Biased, each dataset has distinct controlled types of bias;\\\\n- Imbalanced, this setting presents a extremely low prevalence of positive class;\\\\n- Dynamic, with temporal data and observed distribution shifts;  \\\\n- Privacy preserving, to protect the identity of potential applicants we have applied differential privacy techniques (noise addition), feature encoding and trained a generative model (CTGAN).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F3349776%2F4271ec763b04362801df2660c6e2ec30%2FScreenshot%20from%202022-11-29%2017-42-41.png?generation=1669743799938811&alt=media)\\\\n\\\\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F3349776%2Faf502caf5b9e370b869b85c9d4642c5c%2FScreenshot%20from%202022-12-15%2015-17-59.png?generation=1671117525527314&alt=media)\\\\n\\\\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F3349776%2Ff3789bd484ee392d648b7809429134df%2FScreenshot%20from%202022-11-29%2017-40-58.png?generation=1669743681526133&alt=media)\\\\n\\\\n**Each
